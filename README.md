## Why Britain Has Stagnated
 
This is an e-book version of the excellent essay that was originally published here:

I’ve made every effort to accurately port the web page across to a nicely readable e-book format: partly for the practice, partly to mess around with what is and what is not possible, but mostly because it’s an excellent essay and anything that makes it a little more widely available would hopefully be regarded as A Good Thing.

The web version is the original “master copy”; this is merely a different format of that version, mostly copied and pasted. So if you have any doubts about something that looks wrong, looks like a mistake, etc, go to that version for reference.
